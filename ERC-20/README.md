Create your own Ethereum ERC20 Token.

Step 1: The ERC20 Interface
In Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum, an interface is a piece of reusable code that defines constraints for functions and events, without implementing the function itself. A contract with the ERC20 interface must have implemented all functions defined in the interface. Create SafeMath.sol and ERC20.sol files.

Step 2: Implementing our functions
