# Standard Smart Contract Types</p>
This repo contains Solidity smart contract code for simple, standards-compliant tokens on Ethereum. Adhering to standards allows other contract developers to easily incorporate your token into their applications.

## Tokens

### Types of tokens

##### Utility Token. Tokens to get a service. Like Ether used for paying fee for transactions. 
##### Equity Token. Tokens to invest in company and get the profits.

### Fungible Tokens (Ex. Stock shares) 
 - Interchangeable.
 - Divisible into smaller units.
 - uniform, identical to each other.
### Non Fungible Tokens - (Ex. arts, lands, certificates, cryptokitties)
 - Each unit is unique. there is no repeated unit. 
 - Cannot be divisible into smaller parts.
 - It is not interchangeable.
